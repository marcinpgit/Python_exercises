# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example,
# a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.
# For practice, write this code inside a function.

a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

i = a[0]
j = a[-1]

def funkcja(x, y):
    b = [x, y]
    print(b)

funkcja(i, j)
